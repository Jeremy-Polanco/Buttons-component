<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/kgDJ0Lwz/image.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  At https://buttons-components.netlify.app/
- What was your experience?
   this is a straight forward project heavily based on conditional rendering, conditional classes and css.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I learned how useful && and || operators can be.
- Your wisdom? :)
  Using css variables should be the way to go, it can save a ton of time by just replacing the variable's content if you want to customize it

- [x] User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable the button

- [x] User story: I can have different button sizes
- [x] User story: I can have different colors
- [x] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] User story: I can still access all button attributes
